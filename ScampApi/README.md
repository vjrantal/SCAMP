### Running with specific Tenant and Client ID ###

This makes use of environment variables that need to be added.

In your Package Manager Console, before you debug - add 2 $env variabiels.

'''
PM> $env:APPSETTING_TenantId = "foo"
PM> $env:APPSETTING_ClientId = "bar"
'''
These can be set also from 
Project Properties -> Debug -> Environment Variables to set:
APPSETTING_TenantId  && APPSETTING_ClientId
this format is used as this is what AZW uses
